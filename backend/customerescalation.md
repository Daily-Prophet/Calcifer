This TSG provide a basic overview for the data flows of attendance report and how to handle the customer escalation issues for attendance report, if you want quick figure out the solutions please focus on the [Triage Scenarios](#triage)
and [Known limitations and enhancement](#limitations). also you can locate issues by navigate to [Triage Scenarios](#triage) and filter the sub scenarios by search the keyword(like meetingpolicy/channelmeeting/calendar/coorganizer)

# Core Flow of attendance report

Within the attendance report domain, there are two main flows: the report generation flow and the report retrieval flow.
![Report Generation Flow](./flow1.png)

The above diagram show the data flow for report generation flow, this is an simplified flow based on attendance report perspective. the participants join the meeting through different teams clients, and the clients will pass the participant data to backend service.
the data also include the configuration data(like ecs config,meeting policy,meeting options,user settings). the NGC is one of the core backend service in attendance report flow. After meeting end, NGC will send related data to dependency services according to configuration.
if attendance report is enabled NGC will save a engagement report to scheduling service, and also send a NGCParticipantsActivity to MSAI and also send a meeting end signal to TMIS, the meeting end signal contains the url for the engagement report. Then MSAI/TMIS Received
the signal/data they will try to generate the report. when generate report they will retrieve all the related data from other services. ie: engagement report and meeting details infor from scheduling service, QnA information from yammer service, user name information
from DSAPI service. and after the report generated. the report will be stored in SDS(Substrate Data Storage). This is a storage based on customer's mailbox, it's tenant/user isolated. customer has the full control of their data.
Besides these report, there is also another way to generate the report, it's implemented in the TAC, the report is a simple version of attendance report, usually controlled by tenant admin. and it didn't contains flexible
engagement data, virtual event data, yammer data and so on. usually when customer couldn't download a report, and we couldn't figure out the reason quickly, we would suggest the customer to download report through TAC, it also support live event/broadcast 's reports. but
the retation time of the report is only one month.

![Report Retrieval Flow](./flow2_2.png)

There are multiple ways that customer can do the retrieval of reports, one is as described above, customer can download report thorugh TAC. the other way is through Graph API , in these two cases, we can forward the icms to
corresponding team. while the core flow is the retrieval from teams clients( including desktop/web/android/ios), while this digram will mainly focus on desktop/web client. there are multiple entrances for the reports, like chiclet, attendancetab and so on.(In meeting report is a simple version of attendance report, it can only be accessed during the meeting. it only contains user,action,timestamp information, more details please search inmeetingreport in this page.) while the
wether customer could see the entrances is controlled by ecs/meetingpolicy/meetingoptions. when user click to view or download the attendance report. it will point to backend services, currently most of the requests willl point to TMIS, in GCC it will point to CMD-ArtifactService
and if any of the requests failed, it will fallback to MSAI.

# Owner Teams:

There are two main Project Team for attendance report, `Skype Teams/CMD Client - Meeting Analytics`(The client team for attendance report, short name is MA-Client) and `Teams Meeting Intelligence Service/Teams Meeting Attendance Report` (The backend service team for attendance report, short name is TMIS)
You can just assign ICM to the first project team.

| Screenshot | The scresshot usually should contains the UI of the user experience, like chat panel/meetingoption/attendancetab and also the screeshot of the attendance report. which should give a baisc information of the issues mentioned in ICM. |  
| HAR | The requests that frontend send to backend service. should care about the url request destination, the url pattern, the response status code, the request payload and the response body. the scenarios usually we need to collect har is download failed, missing reports in ar tab. sometimes we also collect har for meeting options. for how to collect har, please refer the [References] [Collect HAR](#collecthar) |  
| PSR | Sometimes we couldn't reproduce the issues customer mentioned, we need to know the detailed steps that cx taken, and cx couldn't provide recording due to some policies, cx/support could provide PSR(Problems steps recorder), Please make sure that the screenshots in the psr files are visiable. |  
| BRB/DiagnosticLogs | The brb or the diagnostic logs contains the details information for the user's client side, it's logged by frontend codes, it contains ecs,meetingpolicy and also the logs for user actions. which will give a detailed logs for the user's setting or actions. for how to collect brb, please refer the [References] |  
| MeetingPolicy | Sometimes we need to make sure that the meeting policy are correctly configed, especially for the policy configed per attendee. there are powershells that we can get the policy and also we can get the policy through TAC. tips: we couldn't set meeting policy for guest users. the policy for guest users are default/hard-coded config. |  
| CSV | The csv file of attendance report |

different data needed for different scenarios, the customized fields are required for each scenario.
| Senario | Data |  
| ----------------------------------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------- |  
| Missing entrance | DiagnosticLogs,HAR,MeetingPolicy,Screenshot |
| Missing Reports | HAR |
| Download failed | HAR |
| Missing Data |HAR,CSV or screenshot,MeetingPolicy for the missing attendee|
| Wrong Report Content | HAR,CSV or screenshot,MeetingPolicy for the wrong attendee|
